# Hints for the Heating control system
## Water Temperature
* Water boils at 100 °C causing high pressure in tubes -> avoid this temperature
* Below 55 °C lime (Kalk) is solved in water, above it falls out of water -> keep below 55 °C if possible

## Burner
* The burner may have (in my case it has) an additional security circle with its own temperature sensor
* Some burners (my one) begin to burn after a delay of many seconds 
-> Therefore the burner can be off even if it is displayed as active
